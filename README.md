# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies plant leaf images to detect diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The app is built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Streamlit**, and trained on the PlantVillage dataset.
